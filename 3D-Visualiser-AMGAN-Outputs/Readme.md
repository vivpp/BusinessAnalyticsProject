Contains neccessary files and links for the 3D plot of the AMGAN outputs using tensorflow's standalone embedding projector tool
- Live version of my implementation of the tool can be found at this link: https://vivpp.github.io/

- Using the outputs from the AMGAN these images were converted into sprite images found in the sprites.png file.
- The tensor.bytes file contains tensors contain classification information related to each sprite.
- The code used to create the sprites and tensor files is the main.py file
- JSON file is the configuration file that is referred to when accessing the live page
